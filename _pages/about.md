Welcome! I am a Research Scientist at [Essential AI Labs](https://www.essential.ai/), where I build foundation models alongside [Ashish Vaswani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oR9sCGYAAAAJ&hl=en) (Attention is All You Need). I was a core contributor to [Rnj-1](https://www.essential.ai/blog/rnj-1), a state-of-the-art open-source coding and agentic foundation model that has amassed 600k+ downloads.

Previously, I was an ML Scientist II at Microsoft Research, where I worked on diffusion models and multimodal large-language models in collaboration with [Vibhav Vineet](https://vibhav-vineet.github.io/), publishing at CVPR, NeurIPS, NAACL, and EMNLP.

I graduated from Georgia Tech with an M.S. in Computer Science, advised by [Zsolt Kira](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~zk15/). Before that, I earned my B.Tech. in Computer Science from IIT Bombay, where I received an Excellence in Research Award under [Soumen Chakrabarti](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LfF2zfQAAAAJ&hl=en).

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
