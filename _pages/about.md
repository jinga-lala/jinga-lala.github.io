Welcome! I am a researcher at Microsoft specializing in the intersection of diffusion models—which are generative models used to create synthetic data—and multimodal large-language models that integrate various data types such as text and images. 
I collaborate closely with [Vibhav Vineet](https://vibhav-vineet.github.io/) on projects aimed at enhancing the capabilities of these models.

Previously, I graduated from Georgia Tech and finished my thesis under the mentorship of [Zsolt Kira](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~zk15/). Before that, I  earned my bachelor's in Computer Science from IIT Bombay, where I received an excellence in research award under the guidance of [Soumen Chakrabarti](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~soumen/).

Feel free to connect with me through the social links below.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
