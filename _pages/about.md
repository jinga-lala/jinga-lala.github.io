I am Yash Jain, an ML Scientist II at Microsoft. My research focuses on the intersection of diffusion models and multimodal large-language models. I regularly collaborate with [Vibhav Vineet](https://vibhav-vineet.github.io/). Previously, I graduated from Georgia Tech under the mentorship of [Zsolt Kira](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~zk15/) and earned my bachelor's in Computer Science from IIT Bombay, where I received an excellence in research award under the guidance of [Soumen Chakrabarti](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~soumen/).

Feel free to connect with me through the social links below.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
